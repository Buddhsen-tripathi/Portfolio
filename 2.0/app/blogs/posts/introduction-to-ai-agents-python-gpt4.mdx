<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">What are AI Agents?</h2>

AI agents are programs or systems that act autonomously to achieve specific goals by perceiving their environment and making decisions. Think of them as digital assistants—sometimes as simple as a thermostat adjusting the temperature, other times as complex as virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa answering your questions.

According to resources like <span className="text-blue-500">[What are AI Agents?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/)</span>, they come in two main flavors:
- **Rule-based agents** that follow predefined instructions
- **Machine learning-based agents** that adapt from data over time.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">How They Work?</h2>

- **Perception**: They gather data from their surroundings, like a user's voice command, sensor readings, or online weather stats.
- **Reasoning**: They process that data using logic, rules, or algorithms—sometimes even learning from past experiences—to figure out what to do next.
- **Action**: They execute a task, whether it's adjusting a setting, answering a question, or suggesting an outfit.

These agents power everything from chatbots handling customer support to Netflix's recommendation engine, silently improving everyday digital interactions.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Types of AI Agents</h2>

AI agents come in various flavors, each suited to different tasks:

- **Simple Reflex Agents**: These follow basic "if-then" rules. For example, if the temperature drops below 20°C, suggest a jacket.
- **Model-Based Reflex Agents**: These keep a mental model of the world. Imagine an agent that remembers yesterday's weather to guess if you'll need an umbrella today.
- **Goal-Based Agents**: These aim for specific outcomes, like ensuring you're comfortable in any weather, even if it means juggling multiple factors like rain and wind.
- **Utility-Based Agents**: These optimize for the best result, maybe suggesting the coziest outfit based on your preferences.
- **Learning Agents**: The smartest of the bunch, these improve over time. Picture an agent that learns you hate coats and swaps them for hoodies, as noted in <span className="text-blue-500">[AI Agents: 5 Key Types Explained With Examples](https://unstop.com/blog/types-of-agents-in-artificial-intelligence)</span>.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Real-World Examples</h3>

AI agents are everywhere, often hiding in plain sight:
- **Chatbots**: Customer service bots on websites use NLP to answer queries, a staple example from <span className="text-blue-500">[36 Real-World Examples of AI Agents](https://botpress.com/blog/real-world-applications-of-ai-agents)</span>.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix suggests shows based on your viewing history—pure agent magic.
- **Robotic Agents**: A Roomba vacuum navigates your floor, dodging obstacles with sensors and actuators.
- **Virtual Assistants**: Siri or Google Assistant handle tasks like scheduling or weather checks, blending perception and action seamlessly.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Why Use AI Agents for Everyday Tasks?</h2>

Tired of repetitive tasks? AI agents can lift that burden. Automating tasks like checking the weather or scheduling meetings saves time, reduces errors, and enhances convenience. For instance, instead of flipping through apps to see if it will rain, an AI agent can fetch the forecast and suggest a raincoat—before you even ask.

The benefits don't stop there. These agents can integrate with smart devices—imagine one tweaking your thermostat based on the day's weather. It's about working smarter, not harder, and that's why we're building one today.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Create a Simple AI Agent: A Weather-Based Clothing Suggester</h2>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Design the Agent</h3>

Before we code, let's outline what our agent should do:

- **Understand You**: Recognize user phrases like "What to wear?" or "What should I wear today?"
- **Get Your Location**: Prompt for city and country code (e.g., "London,uk").
- **Fetch Weather Data**: Use OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather conditions.
- **Make Suggestions**: Apply practical clothing rules based on the data.

**Clothing suggestion logic:**
- Below 10°C: "Heavy coat, gloves, and boots."
- 10–20°C: "Light jacket or sweater."
- Above 20°C: "T-shirt and shorts."
- If it's raining: Add "Bring a raincoat or umbrella."

These rules are inspired by the <span className="text-blue-500">[Simple Guide on What to Wear in 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 Degree Weather](https://the-weather-station.com/what-to-wear-in-30-40-50-60-70-80-weather/)</span>.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Code It in Python </h3>

We will use Python for its simplicity and the `requests` library to interact with external APIs. 

**Setup Steps:**
1. Install dependencies: `pip install requests openai`
2. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
3. Replace `"YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY"` and `"YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"` in the script.
4. Run the code.

```python
import requests
from openai import OpenAI
import traceback

def get_weather(location, api_key):
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={location}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        if 'main' in data and 'weather' in data:
            temperature = data['main']['temp']
            condition = data['weather'][0]['main']
            return temperature, condition
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Incomplete weather data: {data}")
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"[ERROR] Weather API request failed: {e}")
        traceback.print_exc()
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[ERROR] Weather data parsing failed: {e}")
        traceback.print_exc()
        raise

def ask_chatgpt(temperature, condition, location, openai_api_key):
    client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
    prompt = f"The weather in {location} is {temperature:.1f}°C with {condition}. Based on this, what should I wear today? Keep it short and helpful."

    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=100,
            temperature=0.7,
        )
        suggestion = response.choices[0].message.content
        return suggestion.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[ERROR] ChatGPT API call failed: {e}")
        traceback.print_exc()
        raise

def main():
    print("Hi! I'm your weather wardrobe assistant. What can I help you with?")
    user_input = input().lower()
    if "what to wear" in user_input or "what should i wear" in user_input:
        print("Great! Where are you? Enter your city and country code (e.g., 'Tokyo,jp'): ")
        location = input()
        weather_api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY"
        openai_api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"

        try:
            temperature, condition = get_weather(location, weather_api_key)
            print(f"[INFO] Weather fetched successfully: {temperature:.1f}°C, {condition}")
            suggestion = ask_chatgpt(temperature, condition, location, openai_api_key)
            print(f"For {location}, it's {temperature:.1f}°C with {condition}. {suggestion}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[ERROR] Something went wrong: {e}")
    else:
        print("Sorry, I only help with clothing suggestions. Ask me what to wear!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Real-World Examples</h2>

**Example 1:**  
**Input**: "What should I wear today?" → Location: "New York,us"  
**Weather**: 7.7°C, Mist  
**Output**: "For New york,US, it's 7.7°C with Mist. For a day with mist and a temperature of 7.7°C in New York, it's best to wear layers. Consider a long-sleeved shirt or sweater, a warm jacket, and perhaps a scarf. Wear long pants, and consider a hat and gloves if you tend to feel cold. Waterproof or water-resistant footwear is also advisable due to the mist."

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Test and Tweak</h2>

Test with:
- Cold days (e.g., "Moscow,ru" in winter)
- Hot, rainy days (e.g., "Bangkok,th")
- Invalid locations (e.g., "Narnia") to verify error handling.

Want to level up? Add:
- Wind-based checks ("Wear a scarf if windy")
- UV alerts ("Bring sunglasses on sunny days")
- Personalization ("Skip jackets, I prefer hoodies")

---

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Taking It Further</h2>

Here's how to take this agent to the next level:
- **Smarter Chat**: Integrate NLP libraries like `nltk` to handle diverse user queries.
- **Preference Learning**: Let your agent learn your clothing preferences over time.
- **Integrations**: Connect it to smart speakers, messaging apps, or home automation systems.

Would you like me to also generate a downloadable "starter project repo" with README for this?
