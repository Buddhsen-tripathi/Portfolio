**February 14, 2025, marks the end of an era** - React's official team announced the **deprecation of Create React App (CRA)**, urging developers to migrate to **modern frameworks** like **Next.js, React Router v7, or Expo**.

This move isn't surprising, given CRA’s stagnation and the rise of **faster, more optimized build tools** like **Vite**. However, the decision has sparked **mixed reactions** across the developer community.

In this post, we'll cover:

- **Why CRA is being deprecated**
- **How the React community is reacting**
- **What you should do next as a React developer**

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Why Is Create React App Being Deprecated? </h2>

When CRA launched in **2016**, it was a game-changer. It eliminated complex configurations and provided an easy way to bootstrap React apps. However, **frontend development has evolved**, and CRA has struggled to keep up.

Here are some key reasons for its deprecation:

**1. Performance Bottlenecks**

CRA's reliance on **Webpack** made it **slow**, especially compared to modern tools like **Vite**. The **slow startup times and inefficient builds** led many developers to seek alternatives.

**2. Lack of Built-in Features**

Unlike modern frameworks, CRA lacked **essential features** like:

- **File-based routing** 📂
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** 🖥️
- **Code splitting and optimization** ⚡
- **Efficient data fetching** 🔄

Developers had to **manually configure these**, defeating CRA’s original purpose.

**3️. No Active Maintainers**

React's team confirmed that **CRA has no active maintainers**. Instead of reviving it, they decided to **push developers toward better solutions**.

**4. Frameworks Already Solve These Problems**

Modern frameworks like **Next.js, Remix, and Expo** provide a **complete development experience**, including routing, data fetching, and performance optimizations.

With **React officially endorsing frameworks**, it no longer makes sense to maintain CRA.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Community Reaction: Shock, Relief, and Frustration </h2>

The React developer community has **mixed reactions** to the announcement:

### 😱 **"Wait, I still use CRA!"**
Many **beginners and small teams** still use CRA because of its **simplicity**. Some developers are frustrated because they now have to **migrate** their projects.

### 😌 **"Finally, it's dead!"**
Others have **welcomed the move**, seeing it as an opportunity to **move forward with better tooling**.

### 🤔 **"What should I use now?"**
Many devs are asking: **What’s the best alternative?** The answer depends on your project:

- **For new projects** → Use **Next.js, React Router v7, or Expo**.
- **For existing CRA projects** → Migrate to **Vite** for a similar experience.

---

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">What Should You Do Next? </h2>

If you’re currently using CRA, here’s your **game plan**:

**1. For New React Projects** → Use a Framework

React now **officially recommends frameworks** instead of standalone build tools. Your best options:

- **Next.js** → Best for **full-stack applications, SSR, and API routes**.
- **React Router v7** → Best for **client-side routing and SPAs**.
- **Expo (with Expo Router)** → Best for **React Native and cross-platform projects**.

Use the **new CLI commands** to get started:

```bash
# Create a new Next.js app
npx create-next-app my-app

# Create a new React Router v7 app
npx create-react-router-app my-app
```

---

**2. For Existing CRA Projects** → Migrate to Vite

If you have an **existing CRA app**, the best alternative is **Vite**. It offers:

✅ **Faster build times**  
✅ **Better developer experience**  
✅ **Improved performance**  

To migrate from CRA to Vite:

- **Install Vite**:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
```

- **Move your `src` and `public` folders** into the new project.  
- **Update dependencies** in `package.json`.  
- **Test your app** to ensure everything works smoothly.  

> Bonus: Vite is **officially recommended** by React as a base for custom frameworks.

**3. Explore Other Options**

If you're interested in **learning React deeply**, you can build a **custom setup** using:

- **Vite + React Router**
- **Parcel**
- **Custom Webpack setup** (if you're a masochist 😆)

React has **new docs** for **rolling your own framework** <span class="text-blue-500">[here](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app).</span>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">The Future of React Development </h2>

This is a **major shift in the React ecosystem**. By deprecating CRA, React is **fully embracing frameworks**, bringing React **closer to the developer experience of Vue (Nuxt), Svelte (SvelteKit), and Solid (SolidStart).**

Expect:

- More **framework-first** tools from React.  
- A **decline in standalone React setups**.  
- **Vite becoming the de facto build tool** for non-framework apps.  

---

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4">Final Thoughts </h2>

The **death of Create React App** might seem like a big change, but it's **for the better**. It **pushes React development forward**, encourages **better tooling**, and ultimately results in **faster, more scalable apps**.

**If you’re a React developer**, now is the perfect time to **upgrade your workflow** and embrace **framework-based development**.

The React ecosystem is evolving, are you keeping up? <br/>
