Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, live at [buddhsentripathi.com](https://www.buddhsentripathi.com/). <br/>This repository hosts the source code for different iterations of the site.

## üöÄ Versions

### `2.0` (‚ú® Current & Live)
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Supabase (for views/subscriptions)
- **Description:** The latest iteration, focusing on performance, SEO, and a modern developer experience. Features include:
    - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)
    - Self-hosted blog with Markdown
    - View counters & Newsletter subscription
    - Interactive tools and games (e.g., Resume Builder, Code Runner)
- **Status:** Actively developed and deployed.

### `1.0` (Legacy)
- **Tech Stack:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Description:** The original version built with a client-side React setup using Vite. Fast and lightweight, but lacks some of the advanced features of v2.0.
